Google Colab isn't meant to create Minecraft servers, but they can be done. Google Colab promises to work 12 hours straight, however it is possible that it will close if there is no person who is reviewing the page or using the console, basically if the page detects inactivity the process will end. The performance is approximately 12 GB of RAM, along with a processor with a power of 2.2 GHz and 2 theards, this is better than many paid hostings, but it has no support and does not promise to be open always, you can put mods, but it is not advisable to saturate it with many as well as plugins, what limits this server the most is its processor which, It's not very good, any hosting for 12 USD can offer you a higher quality server, if you plan to create something for many users, that's much better. The servers used are Google's along with Ngrok's proxy.
